Automata Simulator
==================

This project provides an API and a simulator for automatas like finite-state
machines which is intended to be a helpful learning tool for computer science
students.

Because, unfortunately, jgraph can not be downloaded from any repository you
have to create a directory called "lib" directly in the base project directory
and download this version of [jgraph][1].
